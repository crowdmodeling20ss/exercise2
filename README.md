# Exercise-2 Vadere

## Output Files
"output" directory which is automatically generated when a vadere scenario is run is ignored by default. Since a lot of tests will be needed to find a correct scenario setting, there will be huge amount of output files. Most probably, we will push all output files which also contain wrong data when a task is completed. To prevent it, output directory is ignored.

**If you want to keep output file in remote, put then into /output-remote directory.**
